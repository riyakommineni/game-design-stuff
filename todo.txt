Hello, 
Welcome to the Simon Game!

This game is fairly straightforward

A square with 4 different colored rectangles will appear on your screen. 
the screen will give the first signal
Repeat that signal by touching the same color.
it will repeat the first signal and then add onemore.
Repeat those two signals in the same order.
it will continue to play the sequence and add one.Continue to repeat Simon for as long as you can!

In level 1, it will go until you reach a score of 10 
Then, you should go to level 2, where it will go until you want to stop 

Have fun!
